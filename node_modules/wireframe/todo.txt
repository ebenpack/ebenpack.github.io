* Is `Scene.prototype.offscreen` correct w/r/t z-index culling?
* `Scene.prototype.fillTriangle` can leave gaps between shared edges
* Refactor `Scene.prototype.renderScene`
* Fix frustum culling
* Is `parseColor` cross-browser compatible?
* Clean up `Scene`
* Improve documentation
* Fix `scene._needs_update` kludge.
* Add mesh deformation methods
* Make movement speed independent of frame rate
* The barycentric/bounding box rasterization method has pretty bad performance. Look into improving it, or replacing it (the original scanline method had much better performance, but the issues with gaps showing at the edges between faces would need to be fixed).
* Improve shading (Gouraud?)
* ~Add mouse event handling~
* ~Make it easier to control meshes in a scene.~
* ~Add tests~
* ~Add `Scene.prototype.removeMesh` method~
